# Bank App Sprint Log: Sprint 1

## Sprint Goal
To build the object-oriented banking system with the ability to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, and save/load data persistently using CSV files.

---

## Tasks Completed

- Created `UserAccount` class with attributes:
  - `username` (str): Username chosen by user
  - `bank_number` (int): 8-digit bank account number
  - `balance` (float): Current account balance

- Implemented methods in `UserAccount`:
  - `deposit(amount)`: Adds a positive amount to the balance
  - `withdraw(amount)`: Removes amount if there is enough money, returns success status
  - `to_dict()`: Converts account data to dictionary for CSV saving
  - `from_dict(data)`: Class method to create a UserAccount object from dictionary data

- Created `BankDatabase` class with attributes:
  - `accounts` (dict): Maps usernames to their `UserAccount` instances

- Implemented methods in `BankDatabase`:
  - `load_accounts()`: Loads accounts from `bank.csv` into the `accounts` dictionary
  - `save_accounts()`: Writes current `accounts` data to `bank.csv`
  - `add_account(account)`: Adds a new `UserAccount` to `accounts` and saves it
  - `generate_bank_number()`: Generates an 8-digit bank number not already in use

- Built test script (`testing.py`) to:
  - Create a user account (`alex123`)
  - Test deposits and withdrawals with success and failure cases
  - Save accounts to CSV
  - Load accounts from CSV into a new `BankDatabase` instance
  - Verify loaded data matches original account details

## Reflections

- Class attributes and method signatures follow design requirements
- Tests cover both success and failure.
- CSV persistence implemented with Pythonâ€™s `csv` module.
- Bank number generation makes sure the 8-digit numbers are unique across all accounts.

---

## Notes for next sprint
- Implement secure log in and account creation.
- Save and load log in and account information from the CSV file.
